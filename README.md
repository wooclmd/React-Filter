# React Filter Functionality with Backend Integration

This project leverages React to create a robust filtering feature. It utilizes both the backend and frontend technologies to enable users to easily and quickly search for individuals based on their names or email addresses.

## Features

- **Backend Integration**: The project connects to a backend server to fetch the required data. Axios, a popular HTTP client, is used to facilitate this communication.

- **Client-Side Rendering**: The data retrieved from the backend is displayed on the client side using React, allowing for dynamic and responsive user interactions.

- **State Management**: React's `useState` hook is employed to manage the application's state. This ensures that user input and filtering preferences are stored and updated effectively.

- **Efficient Searching**: Users can effortlessly search and filter individuals by entering either a name or an email address. The filter functionality efficiently narrows down the results in real-time as the user types.

## How It Works

1. **Backend Data Retrieval**: Upon loading the application, it initiates an HTTP request to the backend server using Axios. This request fetches the necessary data, which typically includes user profiles.

2. **Client-Side Rendering**: The fetched data is rendered on the client side using React components. This allows for a seamless and interactive user experience.

3. **Filtering**: Users can enter a name or an email address in the search input field. As they type, the application dynamically filters the displayed data based on the user's input.

4. **Real-Time Updates**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks ensure that the application responds in real-time to user input, updating the displayed results as the filter criteria change.

5. **User-Friendly**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for users to find the information they need quickly and effortlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend server.
- **JavaScript/ES6**: For programming logic and data manipulation.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating an appealing user interface.
